After lunch on day four, with India needing eight wickets to finish the match, Ashwin found dip and drift. 
Simultaneously, he cut out the loose balls to earn a five-for and a hundred in the same Test for a second time, the most by an Indian. 
West Indies couldn't offer much resistance and folded in 78 overs. 
They had lasted only 12.2 overs longer in the first innings.
Before Ashwin struck, Marlon Samuels and Rajendra Chandrika had managed to hold India up for 22 overs, which did frustrate India a little. Especially after an umpiring decision got India's goat. 
After Umesh Yadav had removed Darren Bravo in the first over of the morning - a repeat feeble push to a wide delivery from the first innings - Mohammed Shami, in his first over of the morning, hit Samuels' glove and offered a low chance to Wriddhiman Saha's left. 
The wicketkeeper claimed immediately.
Coach Anil Kumble, watching from the balcony, lifted his finger after the first replay. 
However, the replays - understandably not adequate in terms of angles or quality for financial reasons - didn't return a verdict beyond reasonable doubt, nor was there a soft signal made by the on-field umpires. 
So the benefit of that doubt went to Samuels. His bat obscured the front-on replay somewhat, and there was nothing else to go by.
